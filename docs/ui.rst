Graphical User Interface
========================

The graphical user interface of Imspector contains some basic elements, that will be explained in the following (:ref:`fig_ui_overview`).
Each measurement may contain one or several measurement windows shown here in the image view (left) and the graph view (middle).
The imaging settings are defined and shown in the live dialogs shown on the right (:ref:`fig_ui_overview`). Furthermore several drop
down menus are available. The live dialogs and measurement windows can be arranged freely in the program workspace.
The arrangement can be saved together with the hardware settings or as a workspace. The menu bar can be modified and saved.
