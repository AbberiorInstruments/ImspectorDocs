While things can be obvious to one user, another might be completely unaware of the feature, even if it was well
labeled by the programmer. Here we have compiled a list of useful tips making daily routine much more efficient.

* :kbd:`ctrl + arrow left/right` moves between the last selections in a stack window. Unfortunately, selections are not
  kept when saving the data.
* Assigning custom shortcuts are very helpful at times! To assign custom shortkeys chose 'Toolbar Options' (the
  small arrows at the end of a toolbar) - 'Add Remove Buttons' - 'Customize' - 'Keyboard'.
* The function 'Change Source File', invoked by :kbd:`ctrl + shift + i` comes handy when inspecting several similar files
  in a folder. But be aware that the window name does not change when the content is changed.
