Direct Port Control
-------------------

Imspector comes bundled with a direct port control utility (MppTest.exe) which allows direct access to serial, parallel, GPIB and QuickUSB devices and can be used to test these devices using the same framework Imspector will use to drive them through its hardware drives.

If you are only interested in MppTest and not in Imspector, check for download links on the `imspector webpage`_ and if non exist, contact the support team.
