MPD Panel Control
-----------------

In theory the MPD panels can be used by several applications in parallel with access synchronized through a service process MpdCtrl.exe. If your panel is not visible from inside Imspector the most common cause is that MpdCtrl is not running or that a wrong version is running.

To start the proper version, stop MpdCtrl.exe by right-clicking the taskbar symbol and choosing Exit. If the symbol is not visible in the taskbar, MpdCtrl is probably not running but you can double-check using the TaskManager. 

Then through the Imspector Tools menu choose "Mpd Panel Control" to re-start the app.  Repeat this step any time you change the version of Imspector you are using.
